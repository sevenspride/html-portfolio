<h1>Im Pat!</h1>
<h2>A short history</h2>
<hr/>
<h2>Early life</h2>

<p>My family came to the United states from Poland to start a better life because they wanted 
    more for there kids than they had growing up. I was born in Philadelphia, PA and have two brothers that were born there as well.
    Growing up in Philadelphia wasnt the easiest thing in the world, the winters were cold and the streets were harsh, and in the neighborhood we grew up in there
    wasnt much room for growth, but life has a funny way of giving you chances when you least expect them. <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>
        When I got to middle school my friend Matt at the time introduced me to music for the first time, musical instruments that is. This is where I fell in love with playing he clarinet 
        and learning everything there was to learn about Jazz, Orechestral arrangments ,music composition and so much more. I stuided for the rest of my middle school and high school career and managed to make some pretty
        substantial accomplishments such as.
        <ul>
<li>Studying at Luzerne music school</li>
<li>Studying with <a href="https://www.philorch.org/about-us/meet-your-orchestra/musicians/samuel-caviezel/">Sam Caviezel</a> from the Philadelphia Orchestra</li>
<li>Making first chair clarinet in Philadelphia Orchestra and concert band</li>
<li>Playing first clarinet in District Orchestra and concert band</li>        
<li>Playing first clarinet in Regional Orchestra and concert band</li>
</ul>
    </p> After Highschool I chose not to go to college because I was afraid of taking on
    a lot of debt and not getting a job that would pay the debt. The field of study I was looking to get 
    into was music education but the school I was going to go to only opted to have a performance art degree
    which I ultimitally decided not to pursue.

    <h2>Adulthood</h2>
    <p>
        After my music I was lost and didn't really know what to do with myself. For 15 years I thought I was going
        to be an orchestral musician or at least a teacher but when that didnt pan out I started working the odd jobs here and there.
        The First job after highschool that I worked was AT&T where I would sell cell phones for 3 years and make a lot of close
        friendships with customers. However as time went on I realized that I wanted more for myself, I didnt just wanna sit here for my 20s selling phones and not growing my skills
        so I decided to take a gamble on myself and apply for new jobs, not really knowing what to expect.
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>After the job at AT&T I took a job with a company called Unifirst, everything on paper looked great but 
        then I realized what it meant to be paid a salary. I thought the sound of 45000 a year for someone
        who was only 21 with no college education sounded great, that was until I started working 14 hour days. When I did the math 
        I realized that I was being had and I had to get out of that situation since it wasnt sustainable for the long term.
     </p>  
     <br>
     <p>Eventually I found a way out of Unifirst into a well paying Union job at a dairy plant called HP.Hood.
here I stayed from 2016-2019 working as a machine operator who would do things such as filling machines with product, taking apart pistons and rebuilding filler heads, rebuilding and replacing O rings, 
washing the inside and outside of the machine with acids and caustics to get it ready for safe production use, and testing titrate samples.
This was a good job for a long time even tho the hours were long but I soon found that I was getting too comfortable and staying stagnant . I had that same 
gnawing feeling that I had at AT&T , I didnt wanna get stale and I wanted more for myself again.
At the same time I had a horribe sense of wonderlust too since all I've ever really seen was PA and the surrounding area. It wasa time for a change.

<h2>A change</h2>
<P>The long days and same routines were starting to take a toll on me with my life. Everytime I drove home
    I'd always imagine what it would be like to, instead of going home, just keep driving west. My mind would wander and think about what it would be like to see
    towering red woods, snow capped mountains, barren deserts, sprawling cities, and everything else that the country had to offer. So I decided it was time for a change, it was time to get my CDL-A.
