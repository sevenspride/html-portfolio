<h1>Patricks Profile</h1>
<h2>I'm a new front end developer</h2>
<p>Hi , my name is Patrick Lapinski and I am a new web developer in training. Below you will find some of my very first projects that I started while working through a bootcamp
    on undemy. With the projects below I made sure to go above and beyond with what was asked and expected of me. I took many of the projects you'll see below
    and added a lot more content and functions than was asked. At the bottom of this page you'll find an about me section where I got over my past and all the things 
    ive done and seen and how I got to where I am today. You'll also find a contact link if you'd like to get in touch with me about anything related to work or life.

<h3>In the link above, what you'll find.</h3>
<p>So I go over my top 5 movies but in the original project we were only asked to use a text based list.
    How I agumented the project was by adding pictures that led to links to IMD and rottentomatoes sites, along with a picture
displaying the movie poster art so that the reader would have an idea of what the movie looks like and doesn't only have to read text. I did it this way
to really hammer home the idea of using anchors in writing html and to see how nesting worked with different attriubutes.
