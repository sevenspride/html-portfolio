<h2>My top 5 movie picks</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>1.   Shaun of the dead</h3>
<p> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/"><img src="shawn of the dead jpeg.jpg"></a>
</p>
<p>Shaun of the dead is a peak early 2000's movie about two best friends trying to make it through a zombie outbreak 
    while trying to figure out some personal issues along the way. This movie features good action
    some horror elements and a ton of good old early 2000's comedy. They sure dont make them like this anymore.
   </p>  
   <ul>
    <li>Comedy</li>
    <li>Action</li>
    <li>Adventure</li>
   </ul>
   <br/>

   <h3>2. Hot fuzz</h3>
   <p> </P><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425112/"><img src="./hot fuzz.jpg"></a>
    <p>Hot fuzz is another buddy comedy that starts off serious and then takes a wacky turn for the comically insane
        when a police officer uncovers a towns dark secret. If you're a fan of Simon pegg then you know what to expect
        and if you aren't a fan yet im sure this will make you one.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comedy</li>
        <li>Action</li>
        <li>Adventure</li>
        <li>Mystery</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <h3>3.  21 days under the sky</h3>
    <p> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5635006/"><img src="./21 days.jpg"></a> 
    </p>

<p> 21 Days under the sky defenitly takes on a different tone from the other movies on this list. This movie is about a band of strangers
    that hardly know each other all having a common goal in mind of getting to a New York
    bike fest from San fransico. The catch is that these arent brand new bikes, infact these are bikes
    these guys have put together in their garages and kept them going through the years.
    But this movie is about much more than just getting to the destination, it tells a story of hardships, growth , and has 
    a fair bet of poetry along the way. This one is near and dear to my heart
    cause it helped me get through a rough patch in my life but also really stoked
    that sense of adventure in my heart. If you're looking for a low key movie
    thats gonna show off some great scenery and a killer score then id defeniltly recommend 
    21 days under the sky.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Adventure</li>
    <li>Thought provoking</li>
    <li>Ambient</li>
    <li>Thoughtful</li>
</ul>

<p> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/"><img
    height="350" src="./lord of the rings.jpg"></a> 
</p>
<p>A classic i'm sure we are all familiar with and if not boy oh boy are you about to be. 
    Just to get through this whole series you'll need a whole day if not a small weekend but I promise the 
    adventure these movies will take you on is an unforgettable one. Lord of the rings
    has love,action,drama,adventure,triumph,defeat ,and all the other attriubutes you look for in a great adventure movie
. 
</p>
<ul>
     <li>Adventure</li>
     <li>Action</li>
     <li>Drama</li>
     <li>Mystery</li>
     <li>Epic</li>

<p><a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/james-bond-movies-in-order/"><img width="300" src="./Bond...James bond.webp"></a>
</p>
<p>Another series near and dear to my heart, not only because of the amazing fasion and suave nature of Bond, but also fond memories
    of thanksgiving day watching James bond marathons on spike tv with my day. These movies have it all, fast cars, beautifulk women, great fasion, great action, and a good story as well.
